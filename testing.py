# Testing framework for similarity-based star prediction

# Outline
# Given a user and a restaurant he has reviewed, remove the contribution
# of said restaurant from that users feature vector. This can be done by
# subtracting out the rating from each category that restaurant is 
# associated with. 

# Run the algorithm on this adjusted user's feature set and restaurant.
# Check how close the output of algorithm is to actual review.
