Final Project Fall 2014

Create a credentials.py file and save to working directory. The file should look like this:
```
# credentials.py
mongo = {
    'user': 'username',
    'secret': 'secret',
    'url': 'oceanic.mongohq.com:10018/playground'
}
```
where username and secret were emailed to you. Keep the url exactly as shown.
